Recursion is a programming and mathematical concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's a powerful and elegant way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Here's a simple explanation of how recursion works: 

Base Case:
Every recursive function has a base case. This is the condition under which the function stops calling itself and returns a result. It prevents infinite recursion. For example, in a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number, the base case might be when the number is 0 or 1, where the factorial is defined as 1.

Recursive Case:
In the recursive case, the function calls itself with a modified version of the problem, typically moving closer to the base case. It then combines the result of the recursive call with some additional work to produce the final result.

So, in simple terms, recursion is a way of solving a big problem by breaking it into smaller, similar sub-problems and using the same method to solve each of them. Once the smallest sub-problems are solved (the base case), you combine the solutions to solve the larger problems until you've solved the entire original problem
