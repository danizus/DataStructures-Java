**Time complexity** is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm or function grows as the input size increases. It tells you how efficient an algorithm is. In simpler terms, it answers the question: "How does the execution time of the algorithm change when the input gets larger?"

Here's a list of functions representing time complexities from best to worst:

1. **O(1) - Constant Time:** The algorithm's runtime does not depend on the input size; it always takes the same amount of time, regardless of how large the input is.

2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:** The runtime grows slowly as the input size increases. Examples include binary search in a sorted array.

3. **O(n) - Linear Time:** The runtime increases linearly with the input size. For each additional element in the input, the algorithm takes an additional step.

4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time:** The runtime grows a bit faster than linear, often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.

5. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time:** The runtime is proportional to the square of the input size. Common in simple nested loops.

6. **O(n^3) - Cubic Time:** The runtime is proportional to the cube of the input size. Often seen in algorithms with three nested loops.

7. **O(2^n) - Exponential Time:** The runtime grows exponentially with the input size. Usually associated with brute-force algorithms.

8. **O(n!) - Factorial Time:** The runtime grows factorially with the input size. Very inefficient and often impractical for large inputs.

**It is an eeficient way to compare two different algorithms as only hardware cannot be used to test the speed of an algorithm.**

Sure, here are the time complexities for common loop scenarios:

1. **Single Loop:** O(n)
2. **Nested Loops:** O(n^2), O(n^3), etc. (depends on the number of nested loops)
3. **Multiple Independent Loops:** O(n) + O(n) + ... = O(n) (assuming they don't depend on each other)
4. **Loop Within a Loop (Nested but Not Fully):** Depends on the exact behavior.
5. **Loop with Varying Bounds:** Depends on the specific behavior, O(k) where 'k' depends on the input.
6. **Recursive Loops:** Depends on the number of recursive calls and what happens at each level of recursion.
