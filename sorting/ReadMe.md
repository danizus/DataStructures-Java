# Selection Sort
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - quadratic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for educational purposes and small datasets. Not recommended for large lists.
- **Algorithm**: Continuously finds the minimum element in an array and exchanges it with the first unsorted element. Repeat until the array is sorted. Great for understanding sorting concepts.


# Bubble Sort

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - quadratic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space.
- **Use Case**: Primarily for educational purposes and small datasets. Not recommended for large lists.
- **Algorithm**: Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, gradually moving the largest elements to the end. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
- **Details**: Bubble Sort is valuable for teaching sorting concepts and algorithmic analysis. However, it's not practical for real-world applications with large datasets.
