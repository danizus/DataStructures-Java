**Selection Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - quadratic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for educational purposes and small datasets. Not recommended for large lists.
- **Algorithm**: Continuously finds the minimum element in an array and exchanges it with the first unsorted element. Repeat until the array is sorted. Great for understanding sorting concepts.


**Bubble Sort**

**Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - quadratic time.
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space.
**Use Case**: Primarily educational; not efficient for large datasets.
**Algorithm**: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, gradually "bubbling" the largest elements to the end. Continue until the entire array is sorted.
**Details**: While not practical for most real-world sorting needs, Bubble Sort is useful for teaching sorting concepts and algorithms' complexity. It has limited practical use due to its inefficiency, especially for large lists.
