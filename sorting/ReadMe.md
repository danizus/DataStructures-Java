**Selection Sort**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) - quadratic time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant space.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for educational purposes and small datasets. Not recommended for large lists.
- **Algorithm**: Continuously finds the minimum element in an array and exchanges it with the first unsorted element. Repeat until the array is sorted. Great for understanding sorting concepts.
